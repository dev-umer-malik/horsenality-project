						<p>Welcome to your Humanality Report!</p>
						<p>We've coined a new word, "Humanality" because we want you to
							expand your thinking about what influences your behavior.
							Consider the situation you are in, your previous experiences, and
							innate tendencies. These combined together are so much more than
							what people usually think about when they use the word
							"personality." The phrase "Humanality" seems to capture the whole
							person best and includes innate characteristics, learned
							behavior, environment, and spirit.</p>
						<p>In this report, we're going to focus on people and their
							wonderful Humanality differences! We're bringing in an expert in
							this area, who is also an avid student of the Parelli program.
							Dr. Patrick Handley, a psychologist and personality assessment
							expert, will share insights about your Humanality strengths and
							challenges. He has worked with us for several years to develop
							and validate this assessment so that it fits our philosophy
							perfectly.</p>

			<div class="card-body">
				<div>Dr. Patrick Handley is a licensed psychologist and personality
					assessment expert. His best-known product, the INSIGHT Inventory, a
					strengths-based personality assessment, and has been used by over a
					million people and translated into seven languages.</div>
				<div>Dr. Handley specializes in researching and developing
					customized personality tests, behavioral feedback questionnaires,
					and leadership assessments. His specialty area of study when
					getting his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology was personality
					assessment and organizational development. Prior to creating his
					own company, he was on the faculty at Virginia Polytechnic
					University and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. In those
					roles he worked directly with students in the counseling and career
					centers and taught graduate level courses in personality assessment
					and personality theory. Since then, in his over 30 years of
					organizational consulting, Dr. Handley has helped numerous
					companies use personality assessments to identify leadership
					potential, build teams, and develop employee talent and potential.
					He now brings all his previous academic and work experience
					together to help co-create the online Parelli Humanality System.</div>
				<div>A lifelong horse owner and avid student of the Parelli program,
					Dr. Handley has worked directly with Parelli Natural Horsemanship
					to take the Parelli Humanality questionnaires to the highest level
					of professionalism and academic standards. This has involved
					recalibrating the original scales and the development of the online
					Humanality questionnaire.</div>
				<div>Dr. Handley views the development of any world-class assessment
					as an ongoing process. To ensure that both the Humanality
					assessments achieve this status, he is managing the factor analysis
					of items, reliability and validity research and continued
					improvement of the supporting reports.</div>

				Parelli Humanality Profile</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				<div>The Parelli Humanality Profile identifies your strengths and
					pinpoints your primary traits in two core traits:
					Extrovert/Introvert and Left-Brain/Right-Brain.</div>
				<div class="fw-bolder">The vertical (up and down) axis on the chart
					measures:</div>
				<div>EXTROVERT (how outgoing, animated, and expressive you are)</div>
				<div>INTROVERT (how reserved, quiet, and non-demonstrative you are)</div>

				<div class="fw-bolder">The horizontal (left and right) axis on the
					chart measures:</div>
				<div>LEFT-BRAIN (how confident, candid, and dominant you are)</div>
				<div>RIGHT-BRAIN (how indirect, emotional, and cautious you are)</div>


				<div>These axes create four Humanality quadrants. There are many
					variations of intensity and each of these fine tunes the
					descriptions of your personality. The first step however is to
					develop an understanding of the four quadrants.</div>
				<div class="fw-bolder">Your Primary Quadrant</div>
				<div>When you review your profile, you'll see a big blue dot that
					indicates which quadrant of behaviors you primarily exhibit. The
					further from the center the dot is, the more intensely you'll
					display the characteristics. This distance is a good indication of
					your spirit level.</div>

				About Humanality</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="w-75">
						<div>Before discussing your Humanality questionnaire results,
							let's explore what makes you the way you are. Your Humanality
							reflects your innate characteristics, learned behaviors,
							adaptation to situations, and spirit/energy level.</div>
						<div>Let's explore how these four factors impact your Humanality.
							Keep in mind that you have self-awareness, can reason at a high
							level, and rather than living in the moment as our friends in the
							animal world do; you can think about the past and future. You
							also have the capacity to observe yourself and figure out why you
							are the way you are. This enables you to understand and
							intentionally change your behavior as you learn and grow.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="w-25">
						<img class="w-75" alt=""
							src="{{asset('assets/reports/temps/humanality/Background (26).png')}}">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="w-25">
						<img class="w-75" alt=""
							src="{{asset('assets/reports/temps/humanality/Background (35).png')}}"><br>
						Part of Humanality comes from your DNA

					</div>
					<div class="w-75">
						<div>Innate characteristics are the traits you were born with and
							inherited in your DNA. Usually these surfaced early and were
							clearly observable by others who knew you when you were a small
							child.</div>
						<div>Research by psychologists and sociologists-primarily in
							studies of twins-suggest that at least 50 percent of your
							Humanality is genetic. Therefore, your DNA can explain
							approximately half of your Humanality tendencies. These traits
							are relatively stable and with you your entire life. The rest are
							learned behaviors.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="my-5">Innate characteristics often determine your
					immediate and instinctive reactions to other people and situations.
					These can really be powerful strengths that help you in many life
					situations.</div>
				<div>However, what you learn sometimes modifies your innate
					reactions. You may learn certain responses that actually conceal or
					cover up your innate tendencies. This is sometimes for the better
					when your innate responses are not productive. It's good that you
					can learn to override these with learned behaviors. For example,
					maybe you are naturally impatient, but you've learned through your
					work with horses to be a more patient person.</div>
				<div>Unfortunately, you may also have learned some behaviors that
					keep you from using some of your innate strengths. For example,
					perhaps you were a joyful expressive child but learned, from strict
					teachers or shy parents, to shut down that side of you.</div>
				<div>To avoid losing some of your strengths you need to rediscover
					them and find ways to use them. Reflect on what behaviors you'd
					like to recapture and take a fresh look at how they may have served
					you positively in the past and consider how they can do the same
					now. Pay close attention to the list of your strengths later in
					this report. This list is designed to help you be the best "you"
					that you can be. Sometimes this means reclaiming your "real" you,
					valuing the innate characteristics you were born with, and learning
					anew to feel good about them.</div>
				<div class="row my-5">
					<div class="w-75">
						<h3>Learned Behavior</h3>
						<div>Learned behaviors are patterns you have adopted by observing
							and interacting with others, consciously or unconsciously.</div>
						<div>As a small child, you initially learn from family members and
							caretakers. Later the influences include playmates, relatives,
							schoolteachers, and other people you were around during your
							childhood and teenage years.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="w-25">
						<img class="w-75" alt=""
							src="{{asset('assets/reports/temps/humanality/Background (26).png')}}">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>You observed and modeled behaviors the quickest when young
					because children (like horses) are great mimics. You watched your
					parents, older siblings and relatives and may have unconsciously
					replicated many of their behavioral patterns. For instance, did you
					ever tell yourself that you were not going to be like your parents?
					Then, as you got older, you caught yourself saying or doing
					something just as your parents might have. That's an example of an
					unconsciously learned behavior.</div>
				<div>On the positive side, you can intentionally identify mentors
					and talented individuals whom you admire and pattern yourself after
					them. When doing so, you can learn and mimic behaviors that help
					you accomplish important personal goals. Once you've mastered these
					desired behaviors, they become a part of who you are. Fortunately,
					we can learn to be better communicators, friends, partners, and
					co-workers.</div>
				<div>When learned behaviors serve you well, they are desirable and
					worth further developing. Challenge yourself to learn to apply
					these with a wider and wider range of people. It's one thing to
					communicate well with a few close friends whom you like and get
					along with. It's quite a different challenge to expand your range
					and communicate well with people you don't like very much or those
					who have quite different personality styles, cultural backgrounds,
					age differences, etc. etc. Getting "good" with people is a lifelong
					process, but it's extremely rewarding.</div>

				<div class="row my-5">
					<div class="w-25">
						<img class="w-75" alt=""
							src="{{asset('assets/reports/temps/humanality/Background (36).png')}}">
					</div>
					<div class="w-75">
						<div>The situation or environment you are in can have an impact on
							how you behave. One situation may include people who bring out
							certain behaviors in you while another situation may inhibit or
							suppress those same traits.</div>
						<div>To truly understand and appreciate your behavior, you must
							consider the various influences within each situation. These can
							cause you to behave in ways that seem inconsistent with who you
							know you are and how you normally behave. Always think about the
							environment you are in when you look at your behavior.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>Different situations also impact other peoples' behaviors. A
					friend can be calm and focused at work, but impulsive, reactive,
					and distracted on vacation. Or, a person that is usually willing
					and cooperative could be frightened or resistant when asked to do
					something out of his or her comfort zone. That person may just not
					like learning new things.</div>
				<div>Situational changes are easier to notice in other people
					because you can see the changes. When changes occur in you, they
					can be much harder to acknowledge because there usually is some
					level of emotion or stress that clouds your self-observation.</div>
				<div>For example, you may believe you are confident at work.
					However, when you are asked to do something new at some community
					organization, you may start remembering a previous problem or
					anxiety you had. The different environment triggers this, but doing
					the same thing in a setting that you are familiar with things does
					not. As a result, when trying a new skill in a new setting you may
					unconsciously send out some anxious energy. This in turn may make
					you more nervous and a problematic cycle starts.</div>
				<div>If you're not careful, you might blame others when the problems
					actually started with you.</div>
				<div>Increasing your awareness of how different situations or
					settings bring out different sides of you is one of the most
					important skills you'll learn in this program. A key goal is to
					help you discover and better understand your innate tendencies but
					also understand how different settings affect your behavior.</div>

				<div class="row my-5">
					<div class="w-75">
						<div>Your spirit and energy level amplifies your Humanality
							traits. People who have high spirit will find their scores
							falling on the outer rings of the chart. People with lower spirit
							plot closer to the center. Spirit refers to intensity, not
							motivation, and does not measure your ability to accomplish
							goals. All scores, regardless of the spirit/energy level, have
							certain strengths. Think of spirit as intensifying your
							Humanality traits.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="w-25">
						<img class="w-75" alt=""
							src="{{asset('assets/reports/temps/humanality/Background (37).png')}}">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>For example, consider two extroverted individuals, one with a
					low spirit/energy level and the other with a high spirit/energy
					level. They each have the same core extroverted trait and will be
					friendly and warm. Although they are both fairly outgoing and
					talkative, the one with the higher spirit comes across as a
					bear-hugging, joke-telling dynamo. The high spirit and energy
					intensify and magnify the extroverted trait.</div>
				<div>Now, consider two introverted people, one with a low
					spirit/energy level and the other with a high spirit/energy level.
					They both are reserved and rather quiet. However the one with the
					higher intensity uses that pronounced introversion to concentrate
					on highly technical information. This person can work alone for
					extended periods of time and even prefers this. The other person,
					the one with low spirit level, is not as introverted. As a result,
					this person only likes to work alone for short periods of time and
					then, gets bored and needs some interaction from others to remain
					engaged and interested. This person's introverted trait is less
					intense, closer to the center of the profile.</div>
				<div>As you look at your Parelli Humanality Profile results, note
					how far out from the center your score (the big blue dot) falls.
					The further out it is, the higher your spirit/energy level or
					"intensity" on that trait.</div>
				<div>Now, let's learn more about the four Humanality types measured
					by the Parelli Humanality Profile.</div>

				Behavior in Different Situations</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				<div>You may find that your behavior changes somewhat from one
					situation to another. This is called "flexing." Your core
					Humanality remains in place, but you behave differently because
					you're adapting to the people you're around or the setting you're
					in. For example, you may alter your behavior at work to accomplish
					specific work goals or fulfill day-to-day responsibilities. At home
					you may display other behaviors when communicating with family
					members. The goal is to behave in ways that improve communications,
					but sometimes certain situations bring out stress reactions.</div>
				<div>To understand how and why your behavior changes, chart your
					style in different situations and notice when your "big blue dot"
					moves, particularly if you switch from one quadrant to another.</div>
				<h3>Identify your primary style at Work (or School) as well as your
					Personal Style and plot these by drawing a dot on the profile

			<div class="card-body">
				<div>Each Humanality type has its strengths and positive
					characteristics. It's important to embrace your strengths and learn
					to use them effectively. This sounds easy, but sometimes it's not.
				</div>
				<div>You may have received messages in the past from others who
					didn't understand why you behaved the way that you did or who
					didn't appreciate your strengths. This probably says more about
					them than it does you, but all the same, these messages may have
					caused you to change your behavior and cover up some of who you
					really are. Even, years later, you may still not be using some of
					your most natural strengths.</div>
				<h3>This section will help you relook at the typical strengths of
					your Humanality type and provide suggestions on ways to bring them
					out in positive, constructive ways. Review the following strengths.
					Check the ones you'd like to keep doing and build upon.</h3>

			<div class="card-header bg-secondary text-white fs-3 fw-bloder">Learning
				More About Yourself From Others</div>
			<div class="card-body">
				<div>It's useful to remember that your Humanality chart is based on
					your own self-ratings. How you see yourself may be different from
					how others see you. To learn more about yourself - a very
					courageous undertaking! - share this report with others (friends,
					family, and perhaps work associates) to get their feedback.
					Remember that everyone will have their own unique perception of
					you. Listen to what they say about you; ask for examples and
					stories and you'll learn how they have formed their viewpoints.</div>
				<div>Here's a good process to follow. First show others where your
					"big dot" plotted and review the general descriptions in earlier
					sections of this report. Then, ask if these match what they
					expected. Consider the reasons that people might have for seeing
					you differently than you see yourself. Perhaps they only know you
					in one setting. Maybe they are recalling a specific occasion when
					you behaved a certain way. Remember, it's not about being "right";
					the conversations you share and what you learn from these are
					what's important.</div>
				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<div>Ask others how they see you. Then draw dots on the chart and
					label them with their names. Compare the variety of locations and
					how these reflect the different relationships with each person.
					Refer to the example below. Use the FEEDBACK WORKSHEET on the next
					page.</div>
